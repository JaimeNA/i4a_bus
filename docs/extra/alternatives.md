# Alternatives node internal network topology

## Current

The current topology being used is token ring.

## Mesh

An alternative would be to use this topology. The worst-case scenario for transmission between devices involves two hops at most. While with a token ring topology, the worst-case scenario involves four hops. The following diagram uses the access point (AP) as the central hub.
